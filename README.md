In this project, I gained valuable experience in various aspects of Node.js and web development. Using Visual Studio Code, I wrote and executed a non-web server on Node.js. I refactored using modern JavaScript syntax which was also practiced throughout this project.

The main task involved creating a "coinage" code module capable of calculating the total value of coin objects.

By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in writing and executing web server Node.js, JavaScript code by specifically utilizing Fastify. I also learned to work with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters.
